# **PFDA – Programming for Data Analysis**
by: Hewa Orang

Welcome to this repository!  
This project contains assignments and a main project focused on programming for data analysis using Python, including data manipulation, visualisation, database operations, and machine learning concepts. The `my-work/` folder contains personal exercises following tutorials, labs, and examples from weekly lectures.

## **Assignment 1 – Bank Holidays Analysis**

This assignment focuses on working with temporal data:

- Analyses bank holiday datasets using Python.
- Demonstrates data processing and manipulation techniques.
- File: `assignment02-bankholidays.py`

This builds foundational skills in handling time-based data.

## **Assignment 2 – Population Analysis & Visualisation**

This assignment covers data visualisation:

- Processes population datasets from multiple sources.
- Creates pie charts and other visualisations.
- Includes notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- Files: `assignment03-pie.ipynb`
- Datasets: `people-1000.csv`,

This demonstrates effective data visualization techniques.

## **Assignment 3 – Population Analysis & Visualisation**

This assignment covers data visualisation:

- Processes population datasets from multiple sources.
- Creates pie charts and other visualisations.
- Includes notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- Files: `assignment03-pie.ipynb`, `assignment05-population.ipynb`
- Datasets: `people-1000.csv`, `population_for_analysis.csv`

This demonstrates effective data visualization techniques.

## **Assignment 6 – Weather Data Analysis**

This assignment analyses meteorological data:

- Works with hourly weather station data.
- Processes and analyses climate observations.
- File: `assignment_6_weather.ipynb`
- Dataset: `hly4935.csv`

This applies data analysis to real-world environmental datasets.

## **Main Project – Wind Speed And Weather Analysis**

**Mace Head Wind Power Analysis**

Assessing wind energy potential for Irish wind farms using 20 years of hourly meteorological observations (2005-2025) from Mace Head, County Galway, Ireland.

- Analyses wind power potential, temporal patterns, and correlations with weather metrics.
- Explores realistic wind farm operating ranges and long-term trends.
- Provides forecasts for future wind farm power output.
- Datasets: `mace_head_daily_data.csv`, `mace_head_hourly_data.csv`, `mace_head_monthly_data.csv`, `mly275.csv`

### **project.ipynb Contents**

- **Section 1: Import Libraries and Load Data** - Data loading and preparation
- **Section 2: Exploratory Data Analysis** - Wind speed characteristics and statistical analysis
- **Section 3: Wind Power Estimation** - Power calculations using turbine physics and performance modeling

This comprehensive project synthesizes all skills learned throughout the course in a real-world renewable energy context.
